# V-Budget (Voiceworx Budgeting Platform)

V-Budget is an internal web application for the Voiceworx Events team to manage vendor rate cards, automate event cost sheets, and streamline approvals. The solution is being built with a modern TypeScript stack so it can evolve into both a responsive web experience and future mobile clients.

## Repository Structure

- `docs/` â€“ Product planning artifacts and architecture notes.
- `frontend/` â€“ Next.js (App Router) frontend with Tailwind CSS styling.

## Getting Started (Frontend)

> **Note:** Package installation commands require internet access. If your environment restricts external downloads, sync dependencies from an approved mirror before continuing.

1. Ensure you have a terminal open on your development machine (macOS, Windows Subsystem for Linux, or Linux) with **Node.js 18+** and **npm** installed.
2. Navigate to the repository folder you cloned from GitHub:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/V-Team-Budget-Easy
   ```

3. Move into the frontend workspace and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the Next.js development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The dev server will start at `http://localhost:3000`. Leave this command running while you work; press `Ctrl+C` in the same terminal when you want to stop it.

### Troubleshooting `npm install`

If `npm install` throws an `EJSONPARSE` error or references a line beginning with `diff --git`, the `frontend/package.json` file was likely corrupted during a manual copy/paste. Validate (and optionally restore) the file with:

```bash
cd frontend
node scripts/check-package-json.cjs --restore
```

Omit `--restore` if you only want to perform a read-only check. After the check completes without errors, rerun `npm install`.

## Current Status

- âœ… High-level product plan capturing workflows, modules, and UI direction (`docs/project-plan.md`).
- âœ… Hand-crafted Next.js frontend scaffold highlighting the hero/landing experience and login layout that reflect the approved wireframe and color palette.
- ðŸš§ Backend services, authentication, data persistence, and automated parsing are upcoming in future iterations.

## Key Design Notes

- Blue (#1E3A8A), black (#111827), and white (#F9FAFB) drive the primary theme.
- Agency fee (%) is applied after the first total, followed by 19% GST on the total inclusive of the agency fee.
- OTP gates protect employee onboarding and vendor rate management, with approvals routed through `rehan@voiceworx.in`.

Contributions and follow-up tasks will expand the budgeting workflows, integrate the approval engine, and flesh out data integrations per the roadmap.
